So many Genesis bits showing up in the beginning of Exodus.

- The sons of Israel being fruitful and multiplying and “swarming” (Gen 1).
- Come let us deal shrewdly (🐍)
- Mortar and bricks (tower in Babylon)
- Moses in the “basket” same word as the “ark”of the flood and pitched with pitch to rescue from the water of death.

Deuteronomy 4:12 (Then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words, but you saw no form—there was only a voice)
This fire is the one the people saw at the mountain. But apparently Moses saw some kind of human form in the burning bush (?), since “the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of the bush” in other words, he saw the angel inside the bush, which blew my mind, since most depictions (Prince of Egypt, Ten Commandments movie, drawings) don’t show this.

In my looking so far, the angel of Yahweh (maybe all angels?) has either had a human form described, or else no visual description, but I don’t know for sure. I certainly had always pictured the bush like in the movies, but then started to wonder when thinking about the 4th man in the fire that did not burn up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and then it felt almost scandalous comprehending the episode in Exodus 24 when the seventy elders of Israel go up the mountain with Moses, Aaron, and his sons, and “they saw the God of Israel; and under his feet like a pavement of sapphire... Yet he did not reach out his hand against the nobles... and they saw God, and they ate and drank.” It felt... wrong... for them to see God with feet and hands, but I had to assume my conceptions were just wrong, maybe even the burning bush movie version.

We certainly get a multifaceted view of God in the Bible, who is unchanging yet constantly surprising and uncontainable... “Will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you...” (1 Kings 8:27)
