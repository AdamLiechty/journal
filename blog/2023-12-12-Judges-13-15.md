The Sampson story so far reads to me like a perfect capturing of testosterone-fueled power unconstrained by wisdom. His first wife is “right in his eyes.” (Genesis 3 warning ⚠️) Yet it was somehow “of the Lord” who was “seeking an occasion against the Philistines.” A riddle there.

The Philistine men use their women to get things from other men, and their neighbors are fine with this unless one miscalculates and gets everyone’s fields burned; then they burn him and his daughter he used.

Samson’s parents seem like they are trying to follow the Lord’s instruction, but before Samson’s birth, his dad doesn’t get the hints that the angel of the Lord seems more interested in speaking to his mom and giving her a special task, than to him.
