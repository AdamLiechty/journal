Names are apparently very important in Genesis 1-11:

- The human has the job of naming the animals
- The human names his wife
- Cain names the first city after his son.
- Parents name their children
- The Nephilim (translated "fallen ones") are all about being strong and having a great name.
- Noah's son Shem (translated "Name") is an ancestor of Abram
- The builders of Babylon are all about making a name for themselves, but end up with a confused name.
