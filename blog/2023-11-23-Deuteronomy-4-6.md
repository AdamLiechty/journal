Moses seems to be saying the Lord gave the nations the heavenly hosts? (4:19) Is Paul working with this worldview in Acts 17:29-31 saying the time for that is over with Jesus?

In 5:3-4 is the emphasis of “did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us” on the distinction between the people of the Exodus and the patriarchs?

5:11 Now that I’ve heard Dr. Carmen Imes explain “bearing” the Lord’s name, the translation “take the name... in vain” seems so impoverished.

Ps 54:4 God is my “helper” is the same word in Gen 2:18 “helper corresponding to [the man]”
Also Dr Imes: this kind of helper is “not someone to make you sandwiches” 😂
