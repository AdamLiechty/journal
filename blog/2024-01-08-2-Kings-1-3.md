I’m confused by 3:27. Looking back at what Elisha says to the king of Israel, he scoffs and tells him to go to Ahab’s and Jezebel’s false prophets and "As surely as the Lord of armies lives, before whom I stand, if I did not respect Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look at you nor see you."
It seems like Israel only gets help because the king of Judah is with them? The "great anger" only comes upon Israel, but not Judah. Is Israel without the protection of Yahweh from Moab’s god?
