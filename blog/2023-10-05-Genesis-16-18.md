Of the slaves Abram acquired in Egypt as a result of mistreating his wife, is
Hagar (the stranger / the immigrant). She "took" and "gave" her "to her husband"
(Genesis 3). Hagar starts to feel superior to Sarai. Abram "solves" this by saying
"your" slave woman is "in your hand. Do to her what is good in your eyes." This
results in Sarai abusing Hagar.

Right after this, Yahweh appears to Abram, saying "walk before me and be blameless"
which is not what he had just done. But God establishes an everlasting covenant.
The sign of this covenant is a sensitive one for all the males, in the area they
make life, after Abram and Sarai had taken advantage of a woman in a vulnerable life
situation.

When the 3 men / Yahweh appear to Abraham, and Abraham intercedes for Sodom, he appeals
to Yahweh as the "judge of all the land" who should do justice. Even as Abraham fears
overstepping his bounds, Yahweh concedes every grace Abraham asks for. There is no
bargaining happening. But Yahweh hears the outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah and will
act on behalf of those crying out.
