David to Saul after he had the chance to kill Saul but didn’t is a wonderful example of leaving vengeance to God and trusting him for his safety and future:
“May the Lord judge between you and me, and may the Lord take vengeance on you for me; but my hand shall not be against you... May the Lord therefore be judge and decide between you and me; and may He see and plead my cause and save me from your hand.”

This is a good statement for me to meditate on some more. It seems like this attitude is reflected in many Psalms.
