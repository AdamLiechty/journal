Num 27:17-18: “‘...so that the congregation of the Lord will not be like sheep that have no shepherd.’ So the Lord said to Moses, ‘Take Ye(ho)shua... a man in whom is the Spirit...’”

Matt 9:36: “When [Yeshua] saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.”
