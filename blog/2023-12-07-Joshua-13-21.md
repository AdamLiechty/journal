No insights from the map with no pictures today, but callouts to:

Baalah, shot-caalah, with 20-inch blades on the impaalah

Carmel: you really must try the corn from there

Og: a fitting name for a giant

Balaam son of Beor (rhymes with Eeyore. Coincidence? ü´è I think not.)

Ether, ahead of its time whose inhabitants invented the Ethernet. Few know this. 

The City of Salt: favorite vacation spot of Lot‚Äôs wife

Ophrah, home of the first talk show

Tabor: creator of great craft brews

Elon: home of the musk oxen
