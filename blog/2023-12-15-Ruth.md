Ruth: We thought you could use a story with a happy ending after reading basically Pulp Fiction. It does make sense of why everyone is so concerned constantly about Ruth being assaulted. 

Judges did feel a bit like “Book of Eli”

Bible Project is fond of calling the Prophets (incl Judges) a “minority report” of the Israelites who weren’t numerically representative of all ancient Israel, but were eventually recognized after the exile hit and people realized they’d been right. 

“In the time of the Judges” now activates something in me like “In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie” does. Judges... #triggerwarning 😅
