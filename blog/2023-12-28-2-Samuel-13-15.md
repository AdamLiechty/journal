As Nathan declared, the sword doesn’t depart from David’s house; it’s also mixed with tragedies due to sexual sin as with David. As the true shoot of Jesse, I’m sure Jesus had this warning in his heart when he said “Those who take the sword will perish by the sword”

In our peaceful corner of the globe, I’m not having to resist violence right now. But I’m challenged by how much these very human stories of sexual sin and violent sin are enmeshed and how a beautiful means of life can become death when seeing/taking what is good in one’s own eyes. 

When Absalom tells his men to kill Amnon in revenge (2 years later... very cold revenge) he sounds like Joshua (Joshua 1:9) “Do not fear; have I not commanded you myself? Be courageous and be valiant.” But he’s not telling them to meditate on the Torah like Joshua was. Good thing politicians don’t use Bible language to justify violence anymore 😬
