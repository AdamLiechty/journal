The list of restrictions (17:16) for future kings is interesting:

1. Don’t acquire lots of horses
2. Don’t make people return to Egypt to get horses
3. Don’t acquire many wives
4. Don’t greatly increase in gold/silver

Solomon will break all 4 of these.

Also (17:18) a king is supposed to make their own copy of the Torah to keep and read daily to keep him humble. Imagine if political leaders read scripture with an eye toward staying humble and not enriching themselves 😬

18:15 an Israelite prophet like Moses is coming. Who will it be? “To him you shall listen.” Remember what the voice from the cloud said at the Transfiguration.
