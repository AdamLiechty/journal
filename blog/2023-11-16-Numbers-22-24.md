I love the Balaam story. It’s so complex. Somehow he knows about and speaks to Yahweh, yet is not his friend (nor is Yahweh his friend... this is the first time in the story the Hebrew word “satan”—adversary, never a proper name—shows up with Yahweh setting himself as Balaam’s adversary).
Fascinating what Balaam is known for by Balak: “he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”—and dark twist on the Lord’s blessing to Abraham and his descendants.
Everyone in this episode is involved in attempting dark mystical death-dealing, but it just crescendoes to blessings on Israel and prophecy of a future (“not near” / “not now”) king from Israel, despite all this.

I don’t know about the meaning here, but Num 24:1-2 is interesting: “When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens, rather he turned his face toward the wilderness. And Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel... and the Spirit of God came upon him.”
I don’t know about this, but on this third time where one opposed to the Lord has death-dealing words turned to life, he turns to the wilderness, with the Spirit of God, and points to the Messiah, echoing the blessing to Abraham, as we’re nearing Deuteronomy.
Jesus, after being baptized, was led by the Spirit, into the wilderness, to meet his adversary, who tries to deal death with cursed words, which Jesus rebuts 3 times with words from Deuteronomy. 🤯

It's also funny that Balaam gives three literall ass-beatings 🫏

RE: “ascended” in Ps 47:5, this is likely not ancient ignorance of not knowing the Lord is everywhere and not confined to certain places. Biblical positional language about ascending and descending is not a 2 or 3D literal thing. Similarly, geography isn’t always either (Ps 48:2 Zion isn’t literally in the far north, but it is in terms of cosmic significance... but that’s a whole rabbit trail about digs at Baal). Ancient chief gods were said to ascend and ride clouds and such, so Biblical language to that effect for the Lord signifies in a way that makes cultural sense that, yes, he has all the power and glory, but pay attention to all the ways that the Lord is quite distinct from the gods, now that we’ve got your attention with this deity symbolism you Ancient Near Easterners know all about.
