I’ve heard some scholars dismiss a link between Solomon’s income of 666 talents of gold and the mark of the beast in
Revelation, but I still wonder about it, with all the overlaps about buying, selling, and trade. The author in 1 Kings
10 is being intentional about describing Solomon's wealth and him doing all the things from Deuteronomy 17 that a king
shouldn't do.
