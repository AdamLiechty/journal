A thought on 30:11 (“not too difficult nor far away”): It feels related to 29:29 “The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us, and to our sons forever, so that we may follow all the words of this Torah” and 30:12 “It is not in the heavens... nor beyond the sea... but the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart that you. may follow it”

I think there is a subtlety to the Torah, us failing it, and Jesus fulfilling it. Genesis indicates that our human vocation is to be the Lord’s partners on earth, and his covenants like this are not inscrutable or undoable (the plain reading of 30:11). Yet we humans didn’t fulfill them, Jesus did, we still don’t, yet we still must (Matt 5:20) by his power and example (Phil 2:5). Somehow these are all true, even if they rub against our various traditions’ systems of interpretation of human nature and how God “logically” must work.
