We haven’t had too many outright declarations of “and what he did was evil in the sight of the Lord” but David’s adultery/murder gets it. 

Joab, who had murdered Abner in vengeance, participates in the conspiracy and uses David’s secret to his political advantage to cover his mistake. David’s response to the collateral damage: war kills people 🤷‍♂️ 

What a warning about how easy it is for power/money/position to make us feel better than and dehumanize others. Wow.

👍 Rahab in Psalm 89:10 is a common word for Egypt portrayed as a sea monster (mirroring the prior verse). In English it looks the same as Rahab from Jericho but in Hebrew they are spelled differently, for the same reason it’s spelled both Hanukkah and Chanukkah in English.
