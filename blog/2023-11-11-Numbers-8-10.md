Psalm 42:1-2 reminds me of Peter saying to Jesus: “Who can we go to? You have the words of everlasting life.”

V3 probably refers to human enemies or “the nations.” This question, “Where is your God?”comes from those two subjects in a handful of other places in the Hebrew Bible, but in v3, the word “they” isn’t even in the Hebrew.

The last verse is beautiful:

Why are you in despair, my soul?
And why are you restless within me?
Wait for God, for I will again praise Him
For the “yeshua” of His presence, my God.
