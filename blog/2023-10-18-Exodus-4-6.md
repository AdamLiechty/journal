Moses brings up his speech problems twice.

Interesting thing pointed out to me recently: Zipporah is the last of 7 women at the beginning of Exodus that save Moses, the Exodus, and the covenant: Shiphrah, Puah (midwives), Moses’ mom and sister (put him in the Nile), Pharaoh’s daughter and servant (draw him out), and Zipporah.
I think the narrator gives us the truncated genealogy to root the priesthood in the tribe of Levi, but not sure why Reuben and Simeon get mentioned first, except that these are the first 3 sons of Jacob in birth order.

The Lord to Moses: “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”

In Matthew 2 an angel tells Joseph to go back “to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.” Matthew with some harsh criticism for how Egypt-like Israel had become. I’m constantly amazed at how realistic the Hebrew scriptural tradition is, pointing out their society’s own failings.
