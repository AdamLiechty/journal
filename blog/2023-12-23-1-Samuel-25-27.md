I love the Nabal/David/Abigail story. For me itâ€™s interesting how not not lifting a finger against the Lordâ€™s anointed (Saul) is a big moral line for David, even when attacked, but he flies into a rage against Nabal and almost murders his household when disrespected and unfairly denied food for his men.

Hebrew help? Footnote with Davidâ€™s threat to kill all the "males" belonging to Nabal gives me the impression heâ€™s being vulgar in his rage, calling them something like "wall-pissers". Does this kind of language show up anywhere else?

Abigailâ€™s words are exquisite in calming David down.

From Allen:
> I think you're on to something -- the phrase "one who urinates on a wall" shows up 6 times in the OT. 1 Sam. 25:22, 34; 1 Ki. 14:10; 16:11; 21:21; and 2 Ki. 9:8. Always in the context of a discussion of wiping out a whole group of men or family. It definitely has a strongly-worded feel to it -- the best dictionary for biblical Hebrew (HALOT) says this of the phrase: "contemptuous expression for masculinity". That's saying it nicely. ðŸ™‚
