Today's video succinctly summarizes the pattern of seeing something good
and taking, and its results. It's hard to not see now, like
with the rebellion of the spiritual beings in Genesis 6: they "saw" that the
daughters of humanity were "good" and "took" resulting in mighty men who
make their own name great and cause problems later in the promised land.

The part that keeps pulling on my heart, though, is from Genesis 4.
Yes, I am my brother's keeper. It's a natural extension of the Genesis 1-2
ideal. And Psalm 2 adds a cosmic scope to it: the nations and the ends of the
earth in the kingdom of the Lord's messiah.
