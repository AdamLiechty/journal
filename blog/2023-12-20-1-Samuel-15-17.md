One of the best stories in the Bible. Goliath’s armor is noted as “bronze” 4 times (sounds like “snake” in Hebrew) and has “scale” armor 🐍 
And David strikes his head and then uses Goliath’s own weapon against him. Genesis 3:15 💥

When Saul was selected by lot he was oddly found hiding among the baggage. Here David boldly leaves the baggage to fight Goliath.
So... as king, Saul came with a lot of baggage? 🤷‍♂️ 😂

Psalm 82:11 says that God judges in the midst of the gods (i.e. not humans here).

Only a few versions I see still translate this as “rulers,” maybe because of worries it doesn’t seem “monotheistic.” But the Bible seems consistent in a worldview that other gods exist, but there are none like Yahweh, the LORD.

I’m convinced by arguments that it’s more straightforward, then, in v6-7 that those gods are being addressed and judged for not ruling justly as listed in v2-5.

v8 is part of why I’m convinced: Arise God, judge the earth, for you shall possess all the nations. What does the judgment against the gods have to do with God possessing all the nations? Note “sons of the Most High” in v6, then, related, Deut 32:8-9 Moses referring to the Tower of Babel and table of 70 nations: “When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When he separated the sons of adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the sons of elohim. For the Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the allotment of his inheritance.”
The argument is that Deut 32 is God giving the nations to the gods, but Israel to himself, and Psalm 82 is about God reclaiming all the nations when those gods ruled them unjustly. This was not something I expected to see in my Bible, but I’ve become convinced that it’s probably what it is saying.
