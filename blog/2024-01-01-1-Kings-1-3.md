Perhaps Psalm 94:1 and the rest of the Psalm are two sides of the same coin? This seems to be the Psalmist taking hold of the promise/command in Deut 32:35 that Paul quotes in Romans 12 and also the writer of Hebrews (Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord). Paul pairs this with radical love for enemies, apparently because vengeance is the Lord’s job, not ours. Yet our Lord himself said “Father, forgive them...” In this Psalm, concern seems to be for the widow, orphan, and immigrant who are killed by people who are the target of the Psalmist’s prayer for vengeance. There are a lot of good tensions and plenty of working out of justice and radical love, costly forgiveness, and reconciliation in this wonderful book we’re reading.
