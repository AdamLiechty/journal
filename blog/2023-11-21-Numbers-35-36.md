One interesting thing is the first mention of the cities of refuge for non-premeditated or possibly accidental killers. Numbers 35:24 “then the congregation shall judge between the one who fatally struck the victim and the blood avenger”

We take for granted that even murderers get trials, with presumed innocence until proven guilty. But that’s the gift of a legal tradition we’ve inherited. Many ancient cultures assumed vigilante justice, but here a big limit gets put on it.

It also echoes what comes after the first murder in Genesis, when the Lord sets a sign for Cain “so that no one finding him would kill him.” The refuge cities function like Cain’s sign.

Another parallel with Genesis 4:
“you are cursed from the ground which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.” And Numbers “blood defiles the land... So you shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell.”
