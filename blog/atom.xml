It seems like Israel only gets help because the king of Judah is with them? The "great anger" only comes upon Israel, but not Judah. Is Israel without the protection of Yahweh from Moab‚Äôs god?</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When things are strange in the Bible, it‚Äôs a clue it might be important... what‚Äôs up with prophets cursing other prophets so that they are killed by a lion?</p><p>RE: the "lying spirit", this is a divine council throne room scene like the beginning of Job where Yahweh gets input from other heavenly beings. </p><p>The similarities are that many heavenly beings are there with Yahweh ruling over them and that he raises a human as the topic of discussion, with someone proposing a course of actions to be taken against him.</p><p>The differences are that in Job, "the satan" (literally "the adversary" and translated as such in other places, but here often translated as a proper name ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ) is the other heavenly being in focus, whereas here in 1 Kings it is a non-specific spirit. In Job, the satan suggests harming the man Job after Yahweh extols him; here, Yahweh specifically asks for help enticing Ahab to go to battle so that he dies. In Job, the narrator directly sets the divine council scene; here, the narrator has the prophet Micaiah narrate a vision of this heavenly scene playing out. Here, there seems to be a tight alignment of obedience of the heavenly beings to Yahweh on the throne even though there seems to first be a debate about how to accomplish Yahweh‚Äôs goal of enticing Ahab. Interestingly, Yahweh approves of this divine lying.</p>]]></content>

This seems to be a warning both against misusing spiritual trust/authority and against being taken in by such misuse.
I‚Äôm surprised by how many sage warnings are embedded in Samuel relevant today to church and power. </p><p>When Absalom gets stuck in the tree, the language seems carefully chosen: ‚Äúhe was placed between the heavens and the earth.‚Äù He‚Äôs portrayed as cursed (from Deut. ‚ÄúCursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree‚Äù) and pierced through the heart. Maybe Paul in Gal 3:13 has both Absalom and Ahithophel in mind for the shame/curse Jesus endured?</p><p>Apparently Absalom means ‚Äúfather (God) is peace.‚Äù This is ironic since Absalom embodies the opposite of peace, along with his statement recorded at the end of his story ‚ÄúI have no son‚Äù?</p>]]></content>

Always in the context of a discussion of wiping out a whole group of men or family.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the best stories in the Bible. Goliath‚Äôs armor is noted as ‚Äúbronze‚Äù 4 times (sounds like ‚Äúsnake‚Äù in Hebrew) and has ‚Äúscale‚Äù armor üêç
And David strikes his head and then uses Goliath‚Äôs own weapon against him. Genesis 3:15 üí•</p><p>When Saul was selected by lot he was oddly found hiding among the baggage. Here David boldly leaves the baggage to fight Goliath.
So... as king, Saul came with a lot of baggage? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üòÇ</p><p>Psalm 82:11 says that God judges in the midst of the gods (i.e. not humans here).</p><p>Only a few versions I see still translate this as ‚Äúrulers,‚Äù maybe because of worries it doesn‚Äôt seem ‚Äúmonotheistic.‚Äù But the Bible seems consistent in a worldview that other gods exist, but there are none like Yahweh, the LORD.</p><p>I‚Äôm convinced by arguments that it‚Äôs more straightforward, then, in v6-7 that those gods are being addressed and judged for not ruling justly as listed in v2-5.</p><p>v8 is part of why I‚Äôm convinced: Arise God, judge the earth, for you shall possess all the nations. What does the judgment against the gods have to do with God possessing all the nations? Note ‚Äúsons of the Most High‚Äù in v6, then, related, Deut 32:8-9 Moses referring to the Tower of Babel and table of 70 nations: ‚ÄúWhen the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When he separated the sons of adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the sons of elohim. For the Lord‚Äôs portion is his people; Jacob is the allotment of his inheritance.‚Äù
The argument is that Deut 32 is God giving the nations to the gods, but Israel to himself, and Psalm 82 is about God reclaiming all the nations when those gods ruled them unjustly. This was not something I expected to see in my Bible, but I‚Äôve become convinced that it‚Äôs probably what it is saying.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A thought on 30:11 (‚Äúnot too difficult nor far away‚Äù): It feels related to 29:29 ‚ÄúThe secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us, and to our sons forever, so that we may follow all the words of this Torah‚Äù and 30:12 ‚ÄúIt is not in the heavens... nor beyond the sea... but the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart that you. may follow it‚Äù</p><p>I think there is a subtlety to the Torah, us failing it, and Jesus fulfilling it. Genesis indicates that our human vocation is to be the Lord‚Äôs partners on earth, and his covenants like this are not inscrutable or undoable (the plain reading of 30:11). Yet we humans didn‚Äôt fulfill them, Jesus did, we still don‚Äôt, yet we still must (Matt 5:20) by his power and example (Phil 2:5).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love the Balaam story. It‚Äôs so complex. Somehow he knows about and speaks to Yahweh, yet is not his friend (nor is Yahweh his friend... this is the first time in the story the Hebrew word ‚Äúsatan‚Äù‚Äîadversary, never a proper name‚Äîshows up with Yahweh setting himself as Balaam‚Äôs adversary).
Fascinating what Balaam is known for by Balak: ‚Äúhe whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.‚Äù‚Äîand dark twist on the Lord‚Äôs blessing to Abraham and his descendants.
Everyone in this episode is involved in attempting dark mystical death-dealing, but it just crescendoes to blessings on Israel and prophecy of a future (‚Äúnot near‚Äù / ‚Äúnot now‚Äù) king from Israel, despite all this.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know about the meaning here, but Num 24:1-2 is interesting: ‚ÄúWhen Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens, rather he turned his face toward the wilderness. And Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel... and the Spirit of God came upon him.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt know about this, but on this third time where one opposed to the Lord has death-dealing words turned to life, he turns to the wilderness, with the Spirit of God, and points to the Messiah, echoing the blessing to Abraham, as we‚Äôre nearing Deuteronomy.
Jesus, after being baptized, was led by the Spirit, into the wilderness, to meet his adversary, who tries to deal death with cursed words, which Jesus rebuts 3 times with words from Deuteronomy. ü§Ø</p><p>It's also funny that Balaam gives three literall ass-beatings ü´è</p><p>RE: ‚Äúascended‚Äù in Ps 47:5, this is likely not ancient ignorance of not knowing the Lord is everywhere and not confined to certain places. Biblical positional language about ascending and descending is not a 2 or 3D literal thing. Similarly, geography isn‚Äôt always either (Ps 48:2 Zion isn‚Äôt literally in the far north, but it is in terms of cosmic significance... but that‚Äôs a whole rabbit trail about digs at Baal). Ancient chief gods were said to ascend and ride clouds and such, so Biblical language to that effect for the Lord signifies in a way that makes cultural sense that, yes, he has all the power and glory, but pay attention to all the ways that the Lord is quite distinct from the gods, now that we‚Äôve got your attention with this deity symbolism you Ancient Near Easterners know all about.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The ordering of commands and narrative today messed with me. I was enjoying the bit about the violet thread at the corner of the Israelites‚Äô clothes as a reminder to see with the eyes of heaven as they went about their day-to-day. A little thread of tabernacle for every member of the kingdom of priests. Anachronistically, this feels a bit ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù. Probably a lot more beauty for me to think about there...</p><p>But then comes the rebellion of some of the Levites, and it feels like they are using this symbolism with the violet threads that brings a bit of tabernacle to everyone, to cause trouble. Do they feel threatened that everyone gets some purple thread when the Levites were supposed to be special? Are they jealous of the priesthood and Aaron and Moses, a subset of the Levites (that seems to be what they are saying more directly)? Whatever it was, they are clearly not happy with their place in the ordering of the nation, and it seems like the symbolism of the violet threads for everyone set them off.</p><p>Whatever happened with the judgment of the sons of Korah, some must have survived, since many of the Psalms are attributed to the sons of Korah.</p><p>RE: ‚Äúthird and fourth‚Äù generations. Literally in Hebrew, it‚Äôs ‚Äúto the third and fourth‚Äù (‚Äúgeneration‚Äù implied, but not there literally). ‚Äú3...4‚Äù is a Hebrew turn of phrase, something like ‚Äúa few‚Äù or ‚Äúas much as needed‚Äù and shows up even in poetic couplets like Proverbs 30:18.</p><p>The handful of generations should be compared to the ‚Äúthousands of generations of those who love me and keep my commandments‚Äù who receive the Lord‚Äôs steadfast love (gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love). Sometimes people repeat their parents‚Äô mistakes/rebellions for a few generations, but the Lord‚Äôs steadfast love is orders of magnitude greater than the effects of those.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Regarding the exclusion of foreigners from Passover, a couple ideas...</p><ol><li><p>It notes that a foreigner can be circumcised with his household and then ‚Äúcome near‚Äù (temple language) and observe Passover.</p></li><li><p>Passover marks the beginning of the new calendar before they head to Sinai and enter the covenant. That covenant begins with ten ‚Äúcommandments‚Äù (literally ‚Äúten words‚Äù), the first of which is ‚ÄúI am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.‚Äù Passover is the divine rescue that is the basis for the covenant, so only participants in the covenant can observe it.</p></li></ol><p>There is a case to be made that Jesus gave Communion as a Passover parallel (he called this ritual meal a new covenant, and the timing...), Paul treats it seriously, and we rightly give it reverence. It‚Äôs open to all, but only after joining that covenant, same as for Passover.</p><p>Lev 10:10 to Aaron (priests) ‚ÄúYou are to distinguish between the holy and the common.‚Äù Practicing distinction is essential to priesthood. Radically, Israel is also to be a kingdom of priests, and even more radically, apparently foreigners can join, if they take the terms of the covenant.</p><p>Just as the Passover was an unconditioned gift to redeem Israel that led to a covenant with conditions (but open to all who will accept them), Jesus‚Äôs sacrifice is an unconditioned gift that leads us to a new covenant, open to all who will accept the terms of his new covenant.</p>]]></content>

I think the narrator gives us the truncated genealogy to root the priesthood in the tribe of Levi, but not sure why Reuben and Simeon get mentioned first, except that these are the first 3 sons of Jacob in birth order.</p><p>The Lord to Moses: ‚ÄúGo back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.‚Äù</p><p>In Matthew 2 an angel tells Joseph to go back ‚Äúto the land of Israel, for those who sought the child‚Äôs life are dead.‚Äù Matthew with some harsh criticism for how Egypt-like Israel had become.

This fire is the one the people saw at the mountain. But apparently Moses saw some kind of human form in the burning bush (?), since ‚Äúthe angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of the bush‚Äù in other words, he saw the angel inside the bush, which blew my mind, since most depictions (Prince of Egypt, Ten Commandments movie, drawings) don‚Äôt show this.</p><p>In my looking so far, the angel of Yahweh (maybe all angels?) has either had a human form described, or else no visual description, but I don‚Äôt know for sure. I certainly had always pictured the bush like in the movies, but then started to wonder when thinking about the 4th man in the fire that did not burn up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and then it felt almost scandalous comprehending the episode in Exodus 24 when the seventy elders of Israel go up the mountain with Moses, Aaron, and his sons, and ‚Äúthey saw the God of Israel; and under his feet like a pavement of sapphire... Yet he did not reach out his hand against the nobles... and they saw God, and they ate and drank.‚Äù It felt... wrong... for them to see God with feet and hands, but I had to assume my conceptions were just wrong, maybe even the burning bush movie version.</p><p>We certainly get a multifaceted view of God in the Bible, who is unchanging yet constantly surprising and uncontainable... ‚ÄúWill God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain you...‚Äù (1 Kings 8:27)</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>70 people from the house of Jacob (numbering the men) come to Egypt who will become a new nation out of the 70 nations divided at Babylon.</p><p>It "rhymes" with Deuteronomy 32:8-9:</p><blockquote><p>When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,<br>
When he separated the sons of adam,<br>
He set the boundaries of the peoples<br>
According to the number of the sons of elohim.<br>
For Yahweh's portion is his people;<br>
Jacob is the allotment of his inheritance."</p></blockquote><p>Note: Some translations <a href="https://www.logos.com/grow/sons-of-israel-or-sons-of-god-in-deuteronomy-32-8-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incorrectly</a> say "according to the number of the sons of Israel."</p><p>The table of 70 nations after the tower of Babylon is followed by Yahweh calling Abram out as the start of a new nation. Now, his descendants are nominally 70 as the response to human (sons of adam) and divine (sons of elohim) rebellion and division, and the vehicle of future blessing of all those nations (Genesis 12:3), but not the sons of elohim (Psalm 82 6-8):</p><blockquote><p>In you all the families of the ground (adamah) will be be blessed</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I said, you are gods,<br>
And all of you are sons of the Most High.<br>
Nevertheless you will die like men (adam),<br>
And fall (niphalu, a verb form of nephilim) like one of the princes.<br>
Arise, elohim, judge the land!<br>
For you possess all the nations.</p></blockquote><p>70 people is small next to 70 nations. Maybe this is part of why, along with Isaiah's suffering servant and of course Jesus being "lifted up" as king by being put on a cross of shame, it's natural for Paul to say:</p><blockquote><p>God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, and the insignificant things of the world and the despised God has chosen.</p></blockquote><p>With Psalm 15 in mind, this is more than a mere Cinderella story; these chosen will have a weighty responsibility to be able to "settle on Yahweh's holy hill."</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Judah/Er/Onan/Tamar story is definitely strange, and I've heard colorful conclusions about the story's meaning jumped to in the past.</p><p>This time I tried to pay attention to repetition to see if anything popped. NASB gives some help about where English translation is sometimes smoothing over repeated words.</p><ol><li>Judah "went down" from his brothers to find his wife</li><li>Er, Judah's firstborn "was evil in the sight of Yahweh, so Yahweh took his life."
No explanation about what he did that was evil.</li><li>Judah tells #2 Onan to perform his duty to "raise up a seed" for his brother.
This is the command in Deuteronomy 25:5-10; if not followed, the widow was to spit in his face and publicly shame the brother.</li><li>Onan knew that "the seed would not be his" so he spilled "on the ground" so that he would not "give a seed" to his brother.</li><li>This was "evil in the sight of Yahweh, so he took his life also."</li><li>Judah doesn't honor what would be codified in Deuteronomy 25:5 for #3 Shelah and eventually
Tamar seems to be vindicated.</li></ol><p>"Went down" / "on the ground" contrasts with "raise up a seed." Er, Onan, and Judah all fail with increasing details given, and Tamar gets a strange honor at the end. Given Judah's role in the messianic line and the focus on "the seed" it feels like the plot conflict is that the seed (tying back to Genesis 3:15) is not going to be "raised up" due to the moral failure of 3 men, so a woman steps in and makes it happen. Was that the "right" thing to do? The narrator doesn't tell us, and leaves us scratching our heads about the perversions, but the plot conflict gets resolved, and their son Perez ends up an ancestor of the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Translation hides the fact that "angel" is just the word "messenger."
Messengers of God meet Jacob, and Jacob sends messengers to Esau. God
meeting Jacob will parallel Jacob meeting Esau.</p><p>It struck me that Jacob's plans to send gifts ahead to Esau ("And behold,
<!-- -->[Jacob]<!-- --> also is behind us") the day before he meets him is with the
reasoning in fear: "Then afterward I will see his <em>face</em>; perhaps he will accept
me." But then, following the wrestling with God, he says "I have seen God <em>face</em>
to <em>face</em>, yet my life has been spared."
("But he himself passed on ahead of them") on his way to his brother. Even
though he sends his family in reverse order of his own favoritism, he puts
himself last by going first, maybe with some new boldness that if he can see God
face to face and be spared, maybe he can see Esau's face and be spared.</p><p>That resonates with some deep need for wildness. I'd rather have God hold my
shoulders and give a firm shake to get my attention than to be gently ignored.</p><p>The episodes of preparing to meet and actually meeting Esau is separated by
wrestling with God. You can feel the suspense as he's by himself awaiting the
reckoning with his past, which is when God shows up to Jacob. To me it felt
like a constrast with Abraham's two covenant encounters with God (15 &amp; 17)
separated by disastrous mistreatment of Hagar (16) who herself gets a visit from
the messenger of Yahweh.</p><p>In other random thoughts, I've long held that America is not a "Christian
nation" because it confuses worldly power for the self-giving way of Jesus. And
I do think it's vital not to read America into the Bible, or ancient Israel,
and certainly not the church.</p><p>But today I wondered, with the confusion about who we are as a country, whether
there is a place for envisioning America hopefully as patterned in its
architecture after a Judeo-Christian Exodus structure whose pluralism is
inherent in that patterning itself.</p><ol><li>Judaic: Founded on laws that order society for a common good and protect
the quartet of the vulnerable: widows, orphans, foreigners, &amp; the poor.</li><li>Christian: Founded on a belief in a new way to be human (where real power
is in serving) and pluralist because that new way to be human speaks for
itself without coercion.</li><li>A nation of Exodus: Simultaneously a people set free, a refuge for those
seeking liberty, and a body infected with injustice in need of constant
reform.</li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of the slaves Abram acquired in Egypt as a result of mistreating his wife, is
Hagar (the stranger / the immigrant). She "took" and "gave" her "to her husband"
(Genesis 3). Hagar starts to feel superior to Sarai. Abram "solves" this by saying
"your" slave woman is "in your hand. Do to her what is good in your eyes." This
results in Sarai abusing Hagar.</p><p>Right after this, Yahweh appears to Abram, saying "walk before me and be blameless"
which is not what he had just done. But God establishes an everlasting covenant.
The sign of this covenant is a sensitive one for all the males, in the area they
make life, after Abram and Sarai had taken advantage of a woman in a vulnerable life
situation.</p><p>When the 3 men / Yahweh appear to Abraham, and Abraham intercedes for Sodom, he appeals
to Yahweh as the "judge of all the land" who should do justice. Even as Abraham fears
overstepping his bounds, Yahweh concedes every grace Abraham asks for. There is no
bargaining happening. But Yahweh hears the outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah and will
act on behalf of those crying out.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today's video succinctly summarizes the pattern of seeing something good
and taking, and its results. It's hard to not see now, like
with the rebellion of the spiritual beings in Genesis 6: they "saw" that the
daughters of humanity were "good" and "took" resulting in mighty men who
make their own name great and cause problems later in the promised land.</p><p>The part that keeps pulling on my heart, though, is from Genesis 4.
Yes, I am my brother's keeper. It's a natural extension of the Genesis 1-2
ideal. And Psalm 2 adds a cosmic scope to it: the nations and the ends of the
earth in the kingdom of the Lord's messiah.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've spent a lot of time in the last few years learning about the ancient context
of the Hebrew Bible, and the ancient Near East worldview of the three-tiered
cosmos. It's now hard to not see it in Genesis 1 now. I've also learned maybe fifty Hebrew words and benefited from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppkdrGStHxm9Q1sjj7qZwf3yqNkwGVU9sumD9LMMTPU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">un-translating</a> select words from Genesis
1-11.</p><p>What jumps out at me now is about the serpent (nachash) and the tree of knowing
good and bad. The nachash doesn't strictly utter any false propositions:</p><ol><li>"Did elohim actually say, 'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden'?"
It's just a question, not a statement.</li><li>"You will not surely die."
She didn't die. No mention of consequences.</li><li>"For elohim knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and
you will be like elohim, knowing good and bad."
She is already like elohim (Genesis 1), and she would "know" good and bad,
<em>experientially</em></li></ol><p>The nachash lies while uttering no technically false statements.
The nachash even uses language from Yahweh's command that Eve does not quote:</p><ol><li><em>surely</em> die</li><li><em>in the day</em> you eat of it</li></ol><p>The nachash never utters Yahweh's name, but always uses "elohim."</p><p>Eve <em>saw</em> that the tree was:</p><ol><li>Good for food</li><li>A delight to the eyes</li><li>Desirable for wisdom</li></ol><p>And she <em>took</em></p><p>Wisdom <em>is</em> desirable and surely Yahweh wanted the humans to have it, so that
they could rule properly as his images. How were they intended to get it?
In the language of the narrative, maybe the tree of knowing good and bad <em>was</em>
the means of acquiring wisdom to judge between good and bad, but the proper way
to acquire it was to obey and not eat of it.
Was the tree guaranteed to give knowledge of good and bad one way or another?
Either through experience by eating of it in disobedience,
or through wisdom by obeying in trust? "The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of
wisdom" according to Psalms and Proverbs. Apparently the right way to "know"
good and bad is a process that starts with trusting and obeying Yahweh, whereas
seeing and taking can cause "knowing" it experientially, and painfully quickly.</p>]]></content>
