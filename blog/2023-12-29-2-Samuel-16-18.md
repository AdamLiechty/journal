16:23 seems to be an addendum to the story to explain the general persuasion of Ahithophel’s advice. “In those days” is the same phrase (both English and Hebrew) as at the end of Judges (“In those days there was no king in Israel...”)
This seems to be a warning both against misusing spiritual trust/authority and against being taken in by such misuse. 
I’m surprised by how many sage warnings are embedded in Samuel relevant today to church and power. 

When Absalom gets stuck in the tree, the language seems carefully chosen: “he was placed between the heavens and the earth.” He’s portrayed as cursed (from Deut. “Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree”) and pierced through the heart. Maybe Paul in Gal 3:13 has both Absalom and Ahithophel in mind for the shame/curse Jesus endured?

Apparently Absalom means “father (God) is peace.” This is ironic since Absalom embodies the opposite of peace, along with his statement recorded at the end of his story “I have no son”?
