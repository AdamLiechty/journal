The means of blessing to all the earth's families is revealed through a specific
call to obedience by Abram, and he obeys, kind of. "Go from your country and
from your relatives..." "and Lot went with him."

Then Abram goes to Egypt and gets wealth and life at the expense of Sarai ("that
I may live on account of you") rather than getting life via trust in the Lord
(Genesis 3 again, even with Sarai: saw-beautiful-took).

Abram's lack of trust means Yahweh even has to bring harm to Pharaoh who seems
innocent here, for the sake of his promise to Abram.

But Abram does a repeat and "called on the name of Yahweh" at the same spot as
before Egypt, but actions from lack of trust will still cause him problems:

- Lot: strife between herdsmen
- "gifts" from Pharaoh that make Abram wealthy, including female servants,
  including Hagar, whom Abram and Sarai will later abuse. He later refuses
  gifts from the king of Salem so he can't say "I've made Abram rich." Maybe
  this is a repentance from letting the king of Egypt do that to him.
- Lot: Abram has to rescue after the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fall into tar
  pits (grim foreshadowing)

Psalm 4: "In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, have me
dwell in safety." Something for me to meditate on when my mind races at night.
