In Job, the satan suggests harming the man Job after Yahweh extols him; here, Yahweh specifically asks for help enticing Ahab to go to battle so that he dies. In Job, the narrator directly sets the divine council scene; here, the narrator has the prophet Micaiah narrate a vision of this heavenly scene playing out. Here, there seems to be a tight alignment of obedience of the heavenly beings to Yahweh on the throne even though there seems to first be a debate about how to accomplish Yahweh\u2019s goal of enticing Ahab.
