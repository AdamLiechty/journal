It\u2019s open to all, but only after joining that covenant, same as for Passover.\\n\\nLev 10:10 to Aaron (priests) \u201cYou are to distinguish between the holy and the common.\u201d Practicing distinction is essential to priesthood. Radically, Israel is also to be a kingdom of priests, and even more radically, apparently foreigners can join, if they take the terms of the covenant.\\n\\nJust as the Passover was an unconditioned gift to redeem Israel that led to a covenant with conditions (but open to all who will accept them), Jesus\u2019s sacrifice is an unconditioned gift that leads us to a new covenant, open to all who will accept the terms of his new covenant."},{"id":"exodus-4-6","metadata":{"permalink":"/journal/blog/exodus-4-6","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-18-Exodus-4-6.md","title":"Exodus 4-6 & Psalm 18","description":"Moses brings up his speech problems twice.","date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"journal","permalink":"/journal/blog/tags/journal"}],"readingTime":0.835,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Liechty","url":"https://github.com/adamliechty","image_url":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"exodus-4-6","title":"Exodus 4-6 & Psalm 18","authors":{"name":"Adam Liechty","url":"https://github.com/adamliechty","image_url":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png"},"tags":["journal"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Exodus 10-12 & Psalm 20","permalink":"/journal/blog/exodus-10-12"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exodus 1-3 & Psalm 17","permalink":"/journal/blog/exodus-1-3"}},"content":"Moses brings up his speech problems twice.\\n\\nInteresting thing pointed out to me recently: Zipporah is the last of 7 women at the beginning of Exodus that save Moses, the Exodus, and the covenant: Shiphrah, Puah (midwives), Moses\u2019 mom and sister (put him in the Nile), Pharaoh\u2019s daughter and servant (draw him out), and Zipporah.\\nI think the narrator gives us the truncated genealogy to root the priesthood in the tribe of Levi, but not sure why Reuben and Simeon get mentioned first, except that these are the first 3 sons of Jacob in birth order.\\n\\nThe Lord to Moses: \u201cGo back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.\u201d\\n\\nIn Matthew 2 an angel tells Joseph to go back \u201cto the land of Israel, for those who sought the child\u2019s life are dead.\u201d Matthew with some harsh criticism for how Egypt-like Israel had become.

It\'s now hard to not see it in Genesis 1 now. I\'ve also learned maybe fifty Hebrew words and benefited from [un-translating](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ppkdrGStHxm9Q1sjj7qZwf3yqNkwGVU9sumD9LMMTPU) select words from Genesis\\n1-11.\\n\\nWhat jumps out at me now is about the serpent (nachash) and the tree of knowing\\ngood and bad. The nachash doesn\'t strictly utter any false propositions:\\n\\n1. \\"Did elohim actually say, \'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden\'?\\"\\n   It\'s just a question, not a statement.\\n2. \\"You will not surely die.\\"\\n   She didn\'t die. No mention of consequences.\\n3. \\"For elohim knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and\\n   you will be like elohim, knowing good and bad.\\"\\n   She is already like elohim (Genesis 1), and she would \\"know\\" good and bad,\\n   _experientially_\\n\\nThe nachash lies while uttering no technically false statements.\\nThe nachash even uses language from Yahweh\'s command that Eve does not quote:\\n\\n1. _surely_ die\\n2. _in the day_ you eat of it\\n\\nThe nachash never utters Yahweh\'s name, but always uses \\"elohim.\\"\\n\\nEve _saw_ that the tree was:\\n\\n1. Good for food\\n2. A delight to the eyes\\n3. Desirable for wisdom\\n\\nAnd she _took_\\n\\nWisdom _is_ desirable and surely Yahweh wanted the humans to have it, so that\\nthey could rule properly as his images. How were they intended to get it?\\nIn the language of the narrative, maybe the tree of knowing good and bad _was_\\nthe means of acquiring wisdom to judge between good and bad, but the proper way\\nto acquire it was to obey and not eat of it.\\nWas the tree guaranteed to give knowledge of good and bad one way or another?\\nEither through experience by eating of it in disobedience,\\nor through wisdom by obeying in trust? \\"The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of\\nwisdom\\" according to Psalms and Proverbs. Apparently the right way to \\"know\\"\\ngood and bad is a process that starts with trusting and obeying Yahweh, whereas\\nseeing and taking can cause \\"knowing\\" it experientially, and painfully quickly."}]}')}}]);
