Biblical positional language about ascending and descending is not a 2 or 3D literal thing. Similarly, geography isn\u2019t always either (Ps 48:2 Zion isn\u2019t literally in the far north, but it is in terms of cosmic significance... but that\u2019s a whole rabbit trail about digs at Baal). Ancient chief gods were said to ascend and ride clouds and such, so Biblical language to that effect for the Lord signifies in a way that makes cultural sense that, yes, he has all the power and glory, but pay attention to all the ways that the Lord is quite distinct from the gods, now that we\u2019ve got your attention with this deity symbolism you Ancient Near Easterners know all about."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
