This seems to be the Psalmist taking hold of the promise/command in Deut 32:35 that Paul quotes in Romans 12 and also the writer of Hebrews (Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord). Paul pairs this with radical love for enemies, apparently because vengeance is the Lord’s job, not ours. Yet our Lord himself said “Father, forgive them...” In this Psalm, concern seems to be for the widow, orphan, and immigrant who are killed by people who are the target of the Psalmist’s prayer for vengeance. There are a lot of good tensions and plenty of working out of justice and radical love, costly forgiveness, and reconciliation in this wonderful book we’re reading.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"1 Kings 20-22 & Psalm 100","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/1-kings-20-22/","content":"When things are strange in the Bible, it’s a clue it might be important... what’s up with prophets cursing other prophets so that they are killed by a lion? RE: the &quot;lying spirit&quot;, this is a divine council throne room scene like the beginning of Job where Yahweh gets input from other heavenly beings. The similarities are that many heavenly beings are there with Yahweh ruling over them and that he raises a human as the topic of discussion, with someone proposing a course of actions to be taken against him. The differences are that in Job, &quot;the satan&quot; (literally &quot;the adversary&quot; and translated as such in other places, but here often translated as a proper name 🤷‍♂️ ) is the other heavenly being in focus, whereas here in 1 Kings it is a non-specific spirit. In Job, the satan suggests harming the man Job after Yahweh extols him; here, Yahweh specifically asks for help enticing Ahab to go to battle so that he dies. In Job, the narrator directly sets the divine council scene; here, the narrator has the prophet Micaiah narrate a vision of this heavenly scene playing out. Here, there seems to be a tight alignment of obedience of the heavenly beings to Yahweh on the throne even though there seems to first be a debate about how to accomplish Yahweh’s goal of enticing Ahab. Interestingly, Yahweh approves of this divine lying.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"1 Kings 8-10 & Psalm 96","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/1-kings-8-10/","content":"I’ve heard some scholars dismiss a link between Solomon’s income of 666 talents of gold and the mark of the beast in Revelation, but I still wonder about it, with all the overlaps about buying, selling, and trade.

So... as king, Saul came with a lot of baggage? 🤷‍♂️ 😂 Psalm 82:11 says that God judges in the midst of the gods (i.e. not humans here). Only a few versions I see still translate this as “rulers,” maybe because of worries it doesn’t seem “monotheistic.” But the Bible seems consistent in a worldview that other gods exist, but there are none like Yahweh, the LORD. I’m convinced by arguments that it’s more straightforward, then, in v6-7 that those gods are being addressed and judged for not ruling justly as listed in v2-5. v8 is part of why I’m convinced: Arise God, judge the earth, for you shall possess all the nations. What does the judgment against the gods have to do with God possessing all the nations? Note “sons of the Most High” in v6, then, related, Deut 32:8-9 Moses referring to the Tower of Babel and table of 70 nations: “When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, When he separated the sons of adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the sons of elohim. For the Lord’s portion is his people; Jacob is the allotment of his inheritance.” The argument is that Deut 32 is God giving the nations to the gods, but Israel to himself, and Psalm 82 is about God reclaiming all the nations when those gods ruled them unjustly. This was not something I expected to see in my Bible, but I’ve become convinced that it’s probably what it is saying.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"1 Samuel 18-20 & Psalm 83","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/1-samuel-18-20/","content":"Jonathan to me seems to be portrayed as both a good neighbor and like a good brother.

He later refuses gifts from the king of Salem so he can't say &quot;I've made Abram rich.&quot; Maybe this is a repentance from letting the king of Egypt do that to him.Lot: Abram has to rescue after the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fall into tar pits (grim foreshadowing) Psalm 4: &quot;In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, have me dwell in safety.&quot; Something for me to meditate on when my mind races at night.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Genesis 8-11 & Psalm 3","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/genesis-8-11/","content":"Names are apparently very important in Genesis 1-11: The human has the job of naming the animalsThe human names his wifeCain names the first city after his son.Parents name their childrenThe Nephilim (translated &quot;fallen ones&quot;) are all about being strong and having a great name.Noah's son Shem (translated &quot;Name&quot;) is an ancestor of AbramThe builders of Babylon are all about making a name for themselves, but end up with a confused name.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Isaiah 42-44 & Psalm 119:1-32","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/isaiah-42-44/","content":"Psalm 119:32: I shall run the way of Your commandments, For You will enlarge my heart.

The part that keeps pulling on my heart, though, is from Genesis 4. Yes, I am my brother's keeper. It's a natural extension of the Genesis 1-2 ideal.

Judah &quot;went down&quot; from his brothers to find his wifeEr, Judah's firstborn &quot;was evil in the sight of Yahweh, so Yahweh took his life.&quot; No explanation about what he did that was evil.Judah tells #2 Onan to perform his duty to &quot;raise up a seed&quot; for his brother. This is the command in Deuteronomy 25:5-10; if not followed, the widow was to spit in his face and publicly shame the brother.Onan knew that &quot;the seed would not be his&quot; so he spilled &quot;on the ground&quot; so that he would not &quot;give a seed&quot; to his brother.This was &quot;evil in the sight of Yahweh, so he took his life also.&quot;Judah doesn't honor what would be codified in Deuteronomy 25:5 for #3 Shelah and eventually Tamar seems to be vindicated. &quot;Went down&quot; / &quot;on the ground&quot; contrasts with &quot;raise up a seed.&quot; Er, Onan, and Judah all fail with increasing details given, and Tamar gets a strange honor at the end. Given Judah's role in the messianic line and the focus on &quot;the seed&quot; it feels like the plot conflict is that the seed (tying back to Genesis 3:15) is not going to be &quot;raised up&quot; due to the moral failure of 3 men, so a woman steps in and makes it happen. Was that the &quot;right&quot; thing to do? The narrator doesn't tell us, and leaves us scratching our heads about the perversions, but the plot conflict gets resolved, and their son Perez ends up an ancestor of the Lion of the tribe of Judah.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Joshua 13-21 & Psalm 68","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/joshua-13-21/","content":"No insights from the map with no pictures today, but callouts to: Baalah, shot-caalah, with 20-inch blades on the impaalah Carmel: you really must try the corn from there Og: a fitting name for a giant Balaam son of Beor (rhymes with Eeyore.

The Philistine men use their women to get things from other men, and their neighbors are fine with this unless one miscalculates and gets everyone’s fields burned; then they burn him and his daughter he used.

Numbers 35:24 “then the congregation shall judge between the one who fatally struck the victim and the blood avenger” We take for granted that even murderers get trials, with presumed innocence until proven guilty. But that’s the gift of a legal tradition we’ve inherited. Many ancient cultures assumed vigilante justice, but here a big limit gets put on it. It also echoes what comes after the first murder in Genesis, when the Lord sets a sign for Cain “so that no one finding him would kill him.” The refuge cities function like Cain’s sign. Another parallel with Genesis 4: “you are cursed from the ground which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.” And Numbers “blood defiles the land...

I was enjoying the bit about the violet thread at the corner of the Israelites’ clothes as a reminder to see with the eyes of heaven as they went about their day-to-day. A little thread of tabernacle for every member of the kingdom of priests. Anachronistically, this feels a bit “democratic”. Probably a lot more beauty for me to think about there... But then comes the rebellion of some of the Levites, and it feels like they are using this symbolism with the violet threads that brings a bit of tabernacle to everyone, to cause trouble. Do they feel threatened that everyone gets some purple thread when the Levites were supposed to be special? Are they jealous of the priesthood and Aaron and Moses, a subset of the Levites (that seems to be what they are saying more directly)? Whatever it was, they are clearly not happy with their place in the ordering of the nation, and it seems like the symbolism of the violet threads for everyone set them off. Whatever happened with the judgment of the sons of Korah, some must have survived, since many of the Psalms are attributed to the sons of Korah. RE: “third and fourth” generations. Literally in Hebrew, it’s “to the third and fourth” (“generation” implied, but not there literally). “3...4” is a Hebrew turn of phrase, something like “a few” or “as much as needed” and shows up even in poetic couplets like Proverbs 30:18. The handful of generations should be compared to the “thousands of generations of those who love me and keep my commandments” who receive the Lord’s steadfast love (gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love). Sometimes people repeat their parents’ mistakes/rebellions for a few generations, but the Lord’s steadfast love is orders of magnitude greater than the effects of those.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Numbers 19-21 & Psalm 46","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/numbers-19-21/","content":"Interesting bit: the fiery snakes/bronze snake are the first appearance of the word “seraphim” in the Bible.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Numbers 22-24 & Psalm 47","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/numbers-22-24/","content":"I love the Balaam story. It’s so complex. Somehow he knows about and speaks to Yahweh, yet is not his friend (nor is Yahweh his friend... this is the first time in the story the Hebrew word “satan”—adversary, never a proper name—shows up with Yahweh setting himself as Balaam’s adversary). Fascinating what Balaam is known for by Balak: “he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”—and dark twist on the Lord’s blessing to Abraham and his descendants. Everyone in this episode is involved in attempting dark mystical death-dealing, but it just crescendoes to blessings on Israel and prophecy of a future (“not near” / “not now”) king from Israel, despite all this. I don’t know about the meaning here, but Num 24:1-2 is interesting: “When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times to seek omens, rather he turned his face toward the wilderness. And Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel... and the Spirit of God came upon him.” I don’t know about this, but on this third time where one opposed to the Lord has death-dealing words turned to life, he turns to the wilderness, with the Spirit of God, and points to the Messiah, echoing the blessing to Abraham, as we’re nearing Deuteronomy. Jesus, after being baptized, was led by the Spirit, into the wilderness, to meet his adversary, who tries to deal death with cursed words, which Jesus rebuts 3 times with words from Deuteronomy. 🤯 It's also funny that Balaam gives three literall ass-beatings 🫏 RE: “ascended” in Ps 47:5, this is likely not ancient ignorance of not knowing the Lord is everywhere and not confined to certain places. Biblical positional language about ascending and descending is not a 2 or 3D literal thing. Similarly, geography isn’t always either (Ps 48:2 Zion isn’t literally in the far north, but it is in terms of cosmic significance... but that’s a whole rabbit trail about digs at Baal). Ancient chief gods were said to ascend and ride clouds and such, so Biblical language to that effect for the Lord signifies in a way that makes cultural sense that, yes, he has all the power and glory, but pay attention to all the ways that the Lord is quite distinct from the gods, now that we’ve got your attention with this deity symbolism you Ancient Near Easterners know all about.","keywords":"","version":null},{"title":"Numbers 8-10 & Psalm 42","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/journal/blog/numbers-8-10/","content":"Psalm 42:1-2 reminds me of Peter saying to Jesus: “Who can we go to?
